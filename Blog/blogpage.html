        <p class="blogarticle" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Workplace well-being</strong> relates to all aspects of working life, from the quality and safety of the physical environment, to how workers feel about their work, their working environment, the climate at work and work organization.</br></br>

              Smart employers know that organisations perform better when staff are healthy, motivated and focused.</br> 
              Research consistently shows that when employees feel their work is meaningful and they are valued and supported, they tend to have <strong>higher wellbeing levels</strong>, be more committed to the organisation’s goals and, importantly, they <strong>perform</strong> better too. </br>
              This strong relationship between levels of staff wellbeing and motivation and business performance is often called ‘employee engagement’.</br></br>
              
              By supporting staff wellbeing, they reap the benefits through enhanced morale, loyalty, commitment, innovation, productivity and profitability. Open and supportive workplaces benefit everyone – employees, employers and the bottom line.</br></br>

        <h3>Raising awareness of mental health and wellbeing</h3>

        <p class="blogarticle" style="text-align: left;">Mental health issues can affect one in four people at some point in their lives and have a significant impact on employee wellbeing. They are a major cause of long-term absence from work. Employers should promote good mental health and provide support for employees who are experiencing mental ill health including anxiety or depression. Here are some practical steps that employers can take to create a mentally healthy workplace and help prevent poor psychological well-being in the first place.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Spotting early signs of mental health issues</h4>
              It is important that line managers have the knowledge and confidence to signpost an employee to more expert sources of support, for example recommending a GP visit or referral to occupational health. Various UK mental health charities (see Useful contacts) also provide helpful resources for individuals, carers and employers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Signposting to support</h4>
              Employers and managers should be alert to the early signs of stress and mental ill health, and know how to respond and signpost to support services. Early intervention can help prevent issues from escalating, but employers should not give advice about a mental health issue as they are rarely qualified to do so. The websites of Mind and Rethink Mental Illness give information on potential signs of mental ill health.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Increasing awareness of how to access employer-funded support</h4>
              Employers who offer an employee assistance programme or counselling services should ensure employees know how to access them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Promote awareness of mental health issues across the workforce</h4>
              Promoting awareness and educating the whole workforce about mental health can help to reduce the stigma and replace common myths with facts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Offer flexible working</h4>
              Offering a more flexible working arrangement can be an adjustment for someone who is returning from work following mental ill health, and it can also help to prevent stress if someone wants a better work-life balance to suit their individual circumstances.</span>
